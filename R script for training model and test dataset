hdata <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=T, sep=",")
names(hdata)
attach(hdata)
 
>sample(4863,2918)

### This command will select 2918 rows or observations randomly out of 4863 observations.
 
>indices<-sample(4863,2918)

### This command will fetch all the records present in these 2918 rows.
 
>indices
 
>hdata[indices,]

### This will give us all the records present in indices.
 
>train<-hdata[indices,]

### This command will insert all the records from the previous query, into a new variable “train”.
 
>train

### This will give us all the records present in indices.
 
>test<-hdata[-indices,]

### This command will fetch all the records present in the dataset but 2918 rows.
 
>test

### This will give us all the records but 2918 rows.
 
>attach(train)
### This will extract the train data of 2918 records.
 
 
>m1<- lm(VAE ~ SizeOfHospital + Community + Type.of.Unit )
###  In this command we are regressing VAE on all of the predictor variable (SizeOfHospital,Community,Type.of.Unit)
 
 
>m1
### This command will give us the result of regression
 
>summary(m1)
### This command will give us the summary of the result, i.e. residuals, estimated standard error, p-value, and t-value.

> plot (m1)
 
OR 
 
The summary function outputs the regression coefficients for all the predictors.
 
>test$VAE
### This command works like the attach command, but instead of extracting records from all the variables, it will fetch only VAE records from test data.
 
 
>t2 <- test[,c("SizeOfHospital", "Community", "Type.of.Unit")]
### This command will remove all the VAE entries from the test dataset.
