Data Modeling:
Categorization of Qualitative Predictors in R:
### Read in VAE data, and attach file , check names.
> hdata<- read.csv(file.choose(), header=T, sep=",")
> attach(hdata)
> names(data1)
  ### Category levels of qualitative predictors(Size of Hospital, Community & type of unit):
> levels(hdata$SizeOfHospital)
> levels(hdata$Community)
> levels(hdata$Type.of.Unit)
###Summary of the entire data set to see the distribution of values.
> summary(hdata)
 
R script for Boxplots for each predictor variable against VAE incidence rate.
####Boxplot between VAE and Size of Hospital to understand the distribution of VAE rate in each of the variable levels:
>  boxplot(data1$VAE ~ data1$SizeOfHospital, main = "Boxplot VAE Vs Size Of Hospital",ylab = "VAE", col = c("yellow","lightblue","red"), cex = 0.35, las = 1, ylim = c(0,0.03))
###Boxplot between VAE and Community to understand the distribution of VAE rate in each of the variable levels:
> boxplot(data1$VAE ~ data1$Community, main = "Boxplot VAE Vs Size Of Hospital",ylab = "VAE",xlab = "Community", col = c("yellow","lightblue","red"), cex = 0.35, las = 1, ylim = c(0,0.03))
###Boxplot between VAE and Type of Unit to understand the distribution of VAE rate in each of the variable levels:
> boxplot(data1$VAE ~ data1$Type.of.Unit, main = "Boxplot VAE Vs TypeOfUnit",ylab = "VAE",xlab = "TypeOfUnit", col = c("yellow","lightblue","red"), cex = 0.35, las = 1, ylim = c(0,0.03))
 
 
 
Hdata <- read.csv(file.choose(), header=T, sep=",")
 
R script for removing outliers
 
>names(Hdata)
### This command will give us the names of all attributes in our table.
 
>attach(Hdata)
 
>quantile(VAE,0.25)
### This command will calculate the first quartile, i.e. Q1
 
>quantile(VAE,0.75)
### This command will calculate the third quartile, i.e. Q3
 
>quantile(VAE,0.5)
### This command will calculate the second quartile, i.e. Q2
